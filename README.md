# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I have created this guide for students in the Bootcamp to help them along with their Prework Webpage. This guide contains notes
on the following languages;Javascript, HTML, Git and CSS. The information contained in this guide will help the students familiarize
themselves with concepts and processes with the above mentioned languages in an accessible and beginner-friendly format. To effectively
understand the material, be sure to revisit and re-read the notes because repitition is crucial to retaining information. To those
who are embarking on their journey toward a career in the tech sector: dont be disheartened if the concepts seem to difficult or obscure,
be persistent and the understanding will reveal itself to you as it did for me.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. If you are open to suggestions as to what you should study first, you will open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows).  A console panel will open either to the side of the webpage, or the bottom of the browser. The console will display a list of topics we learned from the prework along with suggestions on which topic you should start with.
